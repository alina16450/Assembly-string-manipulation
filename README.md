# Assembly-string-manipulation
We are given a doubleword with value 0, and a set of instructions for what the bits in it should be
The instructions are:
Given the bytes A and B, compute the doubleword C as follows:
· the bits 16-31 of C have the value 1
· the bits 0-3 of C are the same as the bits 3-6 of B
· the bits 4-7 of C have the value 0
· the bits 8-10 of C have the value 110
· the bits 11-15 of C are the same as the bits 0-4 of A
The code has imputed some values as well, to demonstrate the process.
